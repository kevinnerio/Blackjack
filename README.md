## Blackjack 
This version of the game only allows one hand per game. One game per simulation. 

Ways to score points:
1) if your hand adds up to 21 then you get a point 
2) if the dealer's hand adds up to 21 he gets a point.
3) if neither you or the dealer score 21, then the person with the highest hand wins
4) if you and the dealer tie, dealer wins.
